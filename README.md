# personal-portfolio-website

1- Tools: I used HTML, CSS, JS, and a CSS framework called Bootstrap, my Portfolio Website is fully responsive and mobile friendly, 
2- Update: I am trying to update it week by week so it will be more friendly and better. 
3- Design and Ideas: all the designs made by myself, with that being said I had some inspiration and used Adobe XD alongside the Project Code.
4- animation and transition: I love to use shapes, animations, and keyframes which makes the website a little more comfortable and friendly attractive ;)
